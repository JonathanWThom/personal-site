      <h3 class="text-left">I like writing code.<h3>
      <h4>I became a developer because I wanted to spend all day solving hard problems and making things work (really). My preferred languages are Ruby and JavaScript, but I'm always looking to learn new things!</h4>

      <h3 class="text-left">Here are some other things I like:</h3>
      <h4>• Laura (see photo)</h4>
      <h4>• Dogs (particulary <%= link_to 'Ernie', 'https://www.instagram.com/p/BP0nu98jnnm/?taken-by=jwthom' %>)</h4>
      <!--add show ernie photo on click function-->
      <h4>• Beer</h4>
      <h4>• Lifting weights</h4>
      <h4>• Sports</h4>
      <h4>This site is a collection point for my thoughts on development (and the other things above), as well as a way to display some of the things I've created. I hope you can add it to the list of things that you like.</h4>
